# README

Your README must explain any particular design decisions or features of your shell. It
should contain at least three parts:
- An introduction to the basic structure of your shell
- A list of which features are fully implemented, partially implemented and not implemented
- A discussion of how you tested your shell for robustness and correctness

You should get used to providing your software with an overview document which will make
granting credits easier. You should write this document especially well if you are unable get
things working completely but have the bones right.
